  [Link 1](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-analytics-vs-data-science) 
 
  >  Data analytics refers to the process and practice of analyzing data to answer questions, extract insights, and identify trends. This is done using an array of tools, techniques, and frameworks that vary depending on the type of analysis being conducted. 

    
    __The four major types of analytics include:__

    - Descriptive analytics,
    - Diagnostic analytics,
    - Predictive analytics,
    - Prescriptive analytics


- __Data Science:__
 
  > Whereas data analytics is primarily focused on understanding datasets and gleaning insights that can be turned into actions, data science is centered on building, cleaning, and organizing datasets. Data scientists create and leverage algorithms, statistical models, and their own custom analyses to collect and shape raw data into something that can be more easily understood.

    
    __Data scientists lay the groundwork for all of the analyses an organization performs. They do this by performing key functions, including:__

    - Data wrangling,
    - Statistical modeling,
    - Programming
      - > The process of writing computer programs and algorithms in a variety of languages—such as R, Python, and SQL—that can be used to analyze large datasets more efficiently than through manual analysis.
